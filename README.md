# Telecom Customer Churn Case Study

## Overview
This project predicts customer churn using a telecom dataset. It covers data preprocessing, feature scaling, dimensionality reduction (PCA), and model training/evaluation using classic ML models.

## What’s inside
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebook analysis
- `reports/` – PDFs or exported results (optional)
- `images/` – charts/screenshots for quick preview (optional)
- `data/` – keep only small sample data (raw datasets are ignored by .gitignore)

## Models used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- PCA for dimensionality reduction

## Evaluation
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report
- ROC-AUC Score

## How to run
1. Install packages:
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Open the notebook:
   - `Telecom Churn Case Study.ipynb`

## Notes
Raw datasets are not included in this repository (to keep it lightweight). Add your dataset locally inside `data/` and update the path in the notebook if needed.
